# React Router V6 Web Application

## Overview

This project is a dynamic web application developed to showcase my proficiency with **React Router V6**. The application illustrates various advanced features and concepts within React Router, demonstrating how they can be leveraged to build a robust and scalable application.

## üîç Key Features Demonstrated

- **Layouts and Index Routes**:
  - Implemented layout components and index routes to manage and structure different views within the application efficiently.
  - This approach enhances the modularity and reusability of the UI components.

- **Nested Routes**:
  - Utilized nested routing to create a hierarchical structure for the application‚Äôs views.
  - This allows for a more organized and intuitive navigation experience.

- **Filtering Results with Search Parameters**:
  - Integrated search parameters to filter and display results dynamically.
  - Demonstrates how React Router can handle complex query logic and state management.

- **Protected Routes for Authenticated Users**:
  - Implemented route protection to ensure that certain areas of the application are accessible only to authenticated users.
  - Highlights how React Router can manage user access and enhance application security.

- **Deferring Data**:
  - Demonstrated the use of deferred data loading techniques to optimize the performance and responsiveness of the application.
  - Leveraged React Router‚Äôs capabilities to load data on demand.

- **Data Router APIs**:
  - Employed data router APIs, including loaders and actions, to handle data fetching and manipulation within the routes.
  - Showcases a modern approach to managing asynchronous data in a React application.

## ‚ú® Integration with Mirage JS

- Integrated **Mirage JS**, a powerful API mocking library, to enhance development and testing.
- Mirage JS allowed the application to be built, tested, and shared without relying on real backend services.
- This made it easier to simulate server responses, handle data dynamically, and focus on refining the front-end experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**
- **React Router V6**
- **Mirage JS**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
